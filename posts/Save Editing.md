Editing the save.xml files opens up a lot of possibilities, but can lead to the game crashing if you change too much (or too little)

Some of the things that can be done by editing the save files are:

- Give human teams Swordfish (or any number of other units)
- Mounting any weapon on an aircraft/ship/turret
- Change vehicle ammunition and hitpoints
- Add/Remove islands (up to the hard limit of 64)
- Modify the carrier and island inventory
- Change island production types
- Change island biomes

There are two community supported map editors:

- cc2me - [https://github.com/cc2modteam/cc2me](https://github.com/cc2modteam/cc2me) - Add/Remove islands units and alter weapon attachments and ammunition counts
- carrier command 2 saves editor - [https://bitbucket.org/Developpeur3d/carrier-command-2-saves-editor/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/Developpeur3d/carrier-command-2-saves-editor/src/master/) - Add/Remove islands, alter carrier inventory and island blueprint types
